# Popular Movies
_Popular Movies_ is an Android app that helps users discover popular and recent movies. I made this app from scratch as a part of the [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegrees-new-s/nd801) program.

## Setup 
The app fetches the movie data from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and it requires an API key to do so. You need to obtain this key from their website. After you do, replace `API_KEY` with your own API key in the `gradle.properties` file.
```
MyTMDBApiKey="API_KEY"
```
